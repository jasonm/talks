!0. introduction / background
!slide fun, sexy, open
  Science should be open
  Science should be sexy
  Science should be fun
say:
  SmartLab is:
  Where "opened source" lab instruments, open data protocols, and electronic lab notebooks
  meet large format interactive displays and augmented reality,
  with a goal of making science more fun, engaging, and with more flow.

  We've got guitar hero, and photoshop hero.
  I want pipette hero.

This talk:
  Sections of this talk parallel the way you use the final product:
    1st Record data with:                    open source lab instruments
    2nd Visualize & interact with data with: a tactile and beautiful platform.
                                             Think "artful hacking" for building an engaging, "flowful" experience
    3rd Publish your results with:           electronic lab notebooks and web-based open access
                                             publishing platforms.

!1. what is it?

!1.1. "opened source" lab instruments
!slide let's get familiar (picture of scientist with pipette)
  "so, what are we working with?"
  The target sciences are anything like cooking.
  For example, chemistry, synthetic biology, molecular biology, and genetics.

  These consist of moving tiny volumes of liquid around, some of which contain interesting molecules.
  We want to mix them, measure and record different properties of them,
  as well as sort them or separate them based on these properties.

!slide "opened source" instruments
  1-Show of hands, how many scientists?
  2-Scientist or not, who uses open source tools?
  3-Open-source or not, how many of you build the tools you use?

I want everybody to do two things:
(1) Invent new tools or rebuild existing tools from scratch, in an open way.
(2) Hack proprietary tools and document their innards in an open way.

!slide freeman dyson's quote

And that includes scientists.
I want a culture of makers/builders/DIYers in chemistry and biology.
I want enhanced tools, hacked tools, DIY tools, free and open tools,
because this *will* make science more affordable, approachable, transparent, and fun.

I love this quote by Freeman Dyson, illustrating the gap between astronomers and biologists;
astronomers do it yourself, biologists (traditionally) don't.  Change that, full stop.

!slide open data logging: physical interfaces, data transfer protocols, data storage formats

Once we have a collection of opened-source lab instruments, we can make them talk to one another,
and to our computers.  Ideally, they would all have WiFi and little HTTP servers inside that
serve and consume well-formed standards-compliant data markup.

There are already open formats for specifying protocols,
specifying dependencies and instructions,
kind of like a .deb and a Makefile all in one.
That's great, there's the format, where's all the data *written up in that format?*

!slide sketch of an open data workflow from protocols to planning to execution to logging and measuring to publication

If we have semantically-encoded recipes ("protocols"), and well-formed streams of instrument data,
we could build a system that can guide us through protocols in realtime.
It receives realtime feedback and confirmation from our instruments that we're doing the right step,
while logging the recorded data for your later viewing, annotation, interpretation, and publication.

# protocol guide (that wired article)
# integrated lab robotics (robot scientist)
# open source high-throughput technologies (polonator.org)

!1.2. artful hacking for an engaging, flowful experience
!slide multitouch usage video/imagery

The right interactions and right feedback cues really reinforce a sense of flow.

As a coder, I've got some sweet ones; autotest, continuous integration,
an editor that is glued into my brain (vim).

But, it's vastly more difficult to add these cues to real life than to
Let's apply bleeding edge technology to do this, but do it thoughtfully.

Making your work more fun is not achieved by sugar-dipping it;
it's achieved by reinforcing flow.

!slide sketch of controls for instruments
NEEDS WORK (tie into previous)

A carefully designed interface can give a common UI to your entire laboratory.

Second, since the instruments can be directed by your computer, you can design scripts
for your experiments, to automate common tasks.

!slide sketch of protocol guide

  imagine a large-format touch-interactive benchtop that projects data onto real physical objects
  with two things: realtime measurements from your open instrumentation, and realtime guidance
  on your semantically encoded protocol steps.

  "Measure out 750uL of tris buffer and dispense it, 75uL at a time, into each of these 10 tubes,"
  and then incubate for 1h.

  IMAGE: protocol guide with these steps, and a timer and temp+sparkline in front of the incubator.

!slide ??? visuals for data manipulation.  maybe cover of tufte book?

  Now you have mountains of open, well-specified data, you can interact with it.
  There's tons of software to do this already, but I think there's a really sweet niche to fill
  in visualizing and manipulating data sets in a large-format and tactile way.

!1.3. open science (recording, publishing)
!slide open science resources (endpoints for these data paths) i.e. oww, arxiv, biologydirect, ntpre

Now that you have all this wonderful data, how do you record and publish it?  Easy; you shouldn't
have to, it should happen automatically.

openwetware.org, to me, is the github of science
full of recipes, results, people, data, schools, igem teams, and more.

A fully open and integrated platform would make painless the process of capturing your results
from instruments, annotating them on your laptop or interactive benchtop, and publishing them
online.

in the future, you could envision a platform like this enabling scientific telepresence,
enabled by realtime video collaboration and remote lab science.

!2. where is it right now
!slide photo of devhouse
This is the result of some of our basement tinkering and
a hack day at betahouse at devhouse boston 5.

Currently, we're moving the setup to a hackerspace in Davis Square called willoughbybaltic.com,
which is a great place to work on it, with an electronics lab and several machining shops,
and soon sporting a biology wetlab.
