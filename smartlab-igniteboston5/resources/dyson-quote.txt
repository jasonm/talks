Why is there this huge difference in cost between the sky survey and the genome project?
Astronomers and biologists have different attitudes toward their tools.
Jim Gunn, one of the leaders of the sky survey, invented and glued together the electronic camera that is the essential observation tool.
Biologists, with a few notable exceptions such as Fred Sanger, traditionally buy their tools and do not build them.
Building their own tools is not a part of their culture.
